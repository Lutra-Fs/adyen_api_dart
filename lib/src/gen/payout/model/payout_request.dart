/// Properties:
/// * [amount] - The amount information for the transaction (in [minor units](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/currency-codes)). For [BIN or card verification](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/cards/bin-data-and-card-verification) requests, set amount to 0 (zero).
/// * [billingAddress] - The address where to send the invoice. > The `billingAddress` object is required in the following scenarios. Include all of the fields within this object. >* For 3D Secure 2 transactions in all browser-based and mobile implementations. >* For cross-border payouts to and from Canada.
/// * [card] - A container for card data. > Either `bankAccount` or `card` field must be provided in a payment request.
/// * [fraudOffset] - An integer value that is added to the normal fraud score. The value can be either positive or negative.
/// * [fundSource] - The person or entity funding the money.
/// * [merchantAccount] - The merchant account identifier, with which you want to process the transaction.
/// * [recurring] - The recurring settings for the payment. Use this property when you want to enable [recurring payments](https://docs.adyen.com/classic-integration/recurring-payments).
/// * [reference] - The reference to uniquely identify a payment. This reference is used in all communication with you about the payment status. We recommend using a unique value per payment; however, it is not a requirement. If you need to provide multiple references for a transaction, separate them with hyphens (\"-\"). Maximum length: 80 characters.
/// * [selectedRecurringDetailReference] - The `recurringDetailReference` you want to use for this payment. The value `LATEST` can be used to select the most recently stored recurring detail.
/// * [shopperEmail] - The shopper's email address. We recommend that you provide this data, as it is used in velocity fraud checks. > Required for Visa and JCB transactions that require 3D Secure 2 authentication if you did not include the `telephoneNumber`.
/// * [shopperInteraction] - Specifies the sales channel, through which the shopper gives their card details, and whether the shopper is a returning customer. For the web service API, Adyen assumes Ecommerce shopper interaction by default.  This field has the following possible values: * `Ecommerce` - Online transactions where the cardholder is present (online). For better authorisation rates, we recommend sending the card security code (CSC) along with the request. * `ContAuth` - Card on file and/or subscription transactions, where the cardholder is known to the merchant (returning customer). If the shopper is present (online), you can supply also the CSC to improve authorisation (one-click payment). * `Moto` - Mail-order and telephone-order transactions where the shopper is in contact with the merchant via email or telephone. * `POS` - Point-of-sale transactions where the shopper is physically present to make a payment using a secure payment terminal.
/// * [shopperName] - The shopper's full name.
/// * [shopperReference] - Required for recurring payments.  Your reference to uniquely identify this shopper, for example user ID or account ID. The value is case-sensitive and must be at least three characters. > Your reference must not include personally identifiable information (PII) such as name or email address.
/// * [telephoneNumber] - The shopper's telephone number.  The phone number must include a plus sign (+) and a country code (1-3 digits), followed by the number (4-15 digits). If the value you provide does not follow the guidelines, we do not submit it for authentication. > Required for Visa and JCB transactions that require 3D Secure 2 authentication, if you did not include the `shopperEmail`.
