/// StoredValueIssueRequest
///
/// Properties:
/// * [amount] - The amount information for the transaction.
/// * [merchantAccount] - The merchant account identifier, with which you want to process the transaction.
/// * [paymentMethod] - The collection that contains the type of the payment method and its specific information if available
/// * [recurringDetailReference] 
/// * [reference] - The reference to uniquely identify a payment. This reference is used in all communication with you about the payment status. We recommend using a unique value per payment; however, it is not a requirement. If you need to provide multiple references for a transaction, separate them with hyphens (\"-\"). Maximum length: 80 characters.
/// * [shopperInteraction] - Specifies the sales channel, through which the shopper gives their card details, and whether the shopper is a returning customer. For the web service API, Adyen assumes Ecommerce shopper interaction by default.  This field has the following possible values: * `Ecommerce` - Online transactions where the cardholder is present (online). For better authorisation rates, we recommend sending the card security code (CSC) along with the request. * `ContAuth` - Card on file and/or subscription transactions, where the cardholder is known to the merchant (returning customer). If the shopper is present (online), you can supply also the CSC to improve authorisation (one-click payment). * `Moto` - Mail-order and telephone-order transactions where the shopper is in contact with the merchant via email or telephone. * `POS` - Point-of-sale transactions where the shopper is physically present to make a payment using a secure payment terminal.
/// * [shopperReference] 
/// * [store] - The physical store, for which this payment is processed.
