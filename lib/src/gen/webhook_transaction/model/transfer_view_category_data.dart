/// The relevant data according to the transfer category.

/// Properties:
/// * [priority] - The priority for the bank transfer. This sets the speed at which the transfer is sent and the fees that you have to pay. Required for transfers with `category` **bank**.  Possible values:  * **regular**: For normal, low-value transactions.  * **fast**: A faster way to transfer funds, but the fees are higher. Recommended for high-priority, low-value transactions.  * **wire**: The fastest way to transfer funds, but this has the highest fees. Recommended for high-priority, high-value transactions.  * **instant**: For instant funds transfers within the United States and in [SEPA locations](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html).  * **crossBorder**: For high-value transfers to a recipient in a different country.  * **internal**: For transfers to an Adyen-issued business bank account (by bank account number/IBAN).
/// * [type] - **bank**
/// * [modificationMerchantReference] - The capture's merchant reference included in the transfer.
/// * [modificationPspReference] - The capture reference included in the transfer.
/// * [authorisationType] - The authorisation type. For example, **defaultAuthorisation**, **preAuthorisation**, **finalAuthorisation**
/// * [panEntryMode] - Indicates the method used for entering the PAN to initiate a transaction.  Possible values: **manual**, **chip**, **magstripe**, **contactless**, **cof**, **ecommerce**, **token**.
/// * [processingType] - Contains information about how the payment was processed. For example, **ecommerce** for online or **pos** for in-person payments.
/// * [relayedAuthorisationData] - If you are using relayed authorisation, this object contains information from the relayed authorisation response from your server.
/// * [schemeTraceId] - The identifier of the original payment. This ID is provided by the scheme and can be alphanumeric or numeric, depending on the scheme. The `schemeTraceID` should refer to an original `schemeUniqueTransactionID` provided in an earlier payment (not necessarily processed by Adyen). A `schemeTraceId` is typically available for authorization adjustments or recurring payments.
/// * [schemeUniqueTransactionId] - The unique identifier created by the scheme. This ID can be alphanumeric or numeric depending on the scheme.
/// * [threeDSecure] - The data of the result from the 3DS authentication.
/// * [validationFacts] - The evaluation of the validation facts. See [validation checks](https://docs.adyen.com/issuing/validation-checks) for more information.
/// * [paymentMerchantReference] - The payment's merchant reference included in the transfer.
/// * [platformPaymentType] - Specifies the nature of the transfer. This parameter helps categorize transfers so you can reconcile transactions at a later time, using the Balance Platform Accounting Report for [marketplaces](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces/reports-and-fees/balance-platform-accounting-report/) or [platforms](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/reports-and-fees/balance-platform-accounting-report/).  Possible values:  * **AcquiringFees**: The acquiring fee (the aggregated amount of interchange and scheme fee) incurred on a transaction.  * **AdyenCommission**: The transaction fee due to Adyen under [blended rates](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/guides/payments-training-guide/get-the-best-from-your-card-processing).  * **AdyenFees**: All transaction fees due to Adyen. This is the aggregated amount of Adyen's commission and markup.  * **AdyenMarkup**: The transaction fee due to Adyen under [Interchange++ pricing](https://www.adyen.com/pricing).  * **BalanceAccount**: The amount booked to your user after the deduction of the relevant fees.  * **Commission**: Your platform's or marketplace's commission on a transaction.  * **DCCPlatformCommission**: The Dynamic Currency Conversion (DCC) fee on a transaction.  * **Interchange**: The interchange fee (fee paid to the issuer) incurred on a transaction.  * **PaymentFee**: The aggregated amount of all transaction fees.  * **Remainder**: The leftover amount after currency conversion.  * **SchemeFee**: The scheme fee incurred on a transaction.  * **Surcharge**: The surcharge paid by the customer on a transaction.  * **Tip**: The tip paid by the customer.  * **TopUp**: An incoming transfer to top up your user's balance account.  * **VAT**: The value-added tax charged on the payment.
/// * [pspPaymentReference] - The payment reference included in the transfer.
